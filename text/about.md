# What is hrefsurf?
hrefsurf is a web directory intended to catalogue interesting websites, and 
allow you to browse and contribute to a better Web.

## Why?
Most people limit their usage of the Web to one of three main places:

1. Social media (e.g., Bluesky, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X etc.)
2. Search engines (e.g., Bing, DuckDuckGo, Google, etc.)
3. Large Language Models (e.g., Claude by Anthropic, ChatGPT, etc.)

It is hrefsurf's opinion that there is a gap left by all of these services
which the Web fills much better.

### Social media hurts people
How does social media suck? Let us count the ways:

1. Social media removes your agency to choose by directing you to
profit-maximizing content.
2. The algorithms which remove your agency often direct you towards harmful
content.
3. The algorithms which remove your agency hide your friends' posts.
4. The algorithms which remove your agency are destroying democracy in the
United States by directing users towards particular political perspectives,
encouraging extremism, and suppressing speech.
5. After suppressing speech and directing you towards particular perspectives,
social media gaslights you into believing they support "free speech" by failing
to moderate hate speech, resulting in constantly toxic comment sections.
6. Then, after depriving you of free speech, they fail to provide meaningful
ways to build and manage communities (since this would not work with a giant
centralized algorithm). You cannot create communities on Instagram whatsoever,
as an example.
6. Social media's incompetent moderators lead to racist, hateful comments
sections
7. Facebook's incompetent moderators in particular led to a brutal genocide
in Myanmar.
8. Social media steals your copyright to give you the privilege of posting
content.
9. Social media changes the terms of the sale, restricting their platforms over 
time, undermining people who build off of their work, and creating favorable
relationships with other rich tech companies.

The oligarchs and complicit, immoral tech workers who work for social media
companies don't care about any of the above. We disagree with their apathy.

Running your own website allows you to preserve your rights. Running your own
website means you control what community it has, and how it is moderated.

Reading websites of your own choice allow you to actively play a role in
your discovery and enjoyment of the Web, instead of feeding it to you with
an algorithm.

We think the Web is worth it, that you have a place in it, and that social media
deprives you of these things, and gaslights you into a world where the Web
doesn't exist.

Enough is enough.

### Search engines don't encourage exploration


### Large Language Models won't fix this
Large Language Models are a genuinely interesting and innovative model for 
querying the knowledgebase of humanity (despite absolutely having flaws and
being intrinsically untrustworthy). However, they do not replace the human
internet.

LLMs regurgitate text ingrained in their models from many, many websites. It is
an evolution of the search engine, enabling easier access to answers for 
particular questions.

However, it misses the creative mark of the Internet. There are not just
questions with answers, but rather, many people who have their own thoughts,
ideas, opinions, art, creations, and lives - all of which won't propagate when
people are not encouraged to *browse*, but rather experience the Web by
merely asking a robot to give answers to specific questions.

hrefsurf fills a useful void in the space that has been neglected by modern,
capitalist-focused trends in technology.

## What hrefsurf offers
hrefsurf differs itself from existing websites in several key areas.

### hrefsurf is Community-Driven
hrefsurf is free to contribute to by anyone, like a wiki. It is designed to
allow people to share cool websites, and find cool websites, which would never
otherwise be accessible (buried under SEO junk in most search engines).

### hrefsurf is Free Content and Free Software
hrefsurf is designed to be as difficult as possible for us to screw you over as
a user.

Firstly, public content on hrefsurf is made available to you under a Free
Content license. The database of websites is made available under the 
Open Database License (OdbL), and the content on the website is made available
under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA 4.0) License.

This means:

- You may freely and legally keep your own copy of this website's public
contents, and share it freely. 
- If we are no longer able to host this website, you are free to pick up the 
mantle, including from other regions less prone to political instability
than the United States.
- You may run analysis on our website data freely, in order to perform research
or track trends. (Please run this on an offline archive, as it is cheaper for us
to process than many API calls)
- We cannot legally take your contributions to our directory and change these
terms. 

In addition, hrefsurf is Free Software, made available under the GNU Affero
General Public License version 3 or later. This is the strongest possible
copyleft license, ensuring that the source code for our website may never be
made private, and allowing others to host their own directories (or clones of
our own) freely.
